Hi there! I'm currently in my first year of studying Cyber Security & Digital Forensics at [Leeds Beckett University](https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/). 
Before I came to LBU, I also did A-Level CompSci and Maths as well as BTEC Game Design at [Notre Dame Sixth Form College](https://www.notredamecoll.ac.uk/).

If you'd like to contact me, send an email to kosiandaniil95@gmail.com anytime and I'll get back to you as quick as I can.
